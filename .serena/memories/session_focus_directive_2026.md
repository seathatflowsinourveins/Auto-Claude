# Session Focus Directive (CRITICAL - Read First)

## Current Priority: UNLEASH SDK Integration

**DO NOT** load or discuss:
- Creative AI / generative art
- TouchDesigner shaders
- State of Witness particles
- MAP-Elites for aesthetics

**ALWAYS** prioritize:
- SDK integration (Voyage, DSPy, Opik, Letta, Temporal)
- Ralph Loop autonomous execution
- Memory architecture improvements
- Cross-session persistence
- Production-ready code

## If Session Drifts

When the user says "wrong direction" or "not about creative AI":
1. Stop immediately
2. Read this memory
3. Delete any creative-focused memories from session context
4. Return to SDK/enhancement work

## Project Detection

If working directory is NOT a project path:
- Default to UNLEASH focus
- Load SDK-related memories only
- Ignore creative/trading memories
