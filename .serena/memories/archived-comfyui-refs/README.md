# Archived: ComfyUI Reference Contamination

> **Archived**: 2026-01-30
> **Reason**: These files contained ComfyUI references that caused context contamination

## Background

WITNESS project uses **TouchDesigner**, not ComfyUI. These memory files from earlier research cycles incorrectly mentioned ComfyUI, causing Claude to hallucinate ComfyUI relevance.

## Prevention

- WITNESS = TouchDesigner (NOT ComfyUI)
- Node-based visual programming, but different platforms
- Future research should reference correct stack

## Note

Episodic memory archive still contains old conversations mentioning ComfyUI.
These are historical and cannot be cleaned without data loss.
