  "content": "Claude Flow V3 & Anthropic Ecosystem Research 2026\n\nKey Findings:\n1. Agent Booster (WASM): 352x speedup, $0/edit, 250% capacity gain - Priority HIGH, LOW complexity\n2. Batch API: 50% discount on all tokens, combines with caching for 90% savings\n3. Prompt Caching: 80-90% cost reduction on cache hits, break-even at 2 calls\n4. ReasoningBank: Distills patterns from successes AND failures, prevents repeated mistakes\n5. SONA: Self-optimizing router with <0.05ms adaptation, 55% quality + 60% cost savings\n6. RuVector: 61\u00b5s vector search with GNN self-improvement\n7. Extended Thinking: Interleaved reasoning between tool calls (beta)\n8. MCP Apps (2026-01-26): Standardized UIs in MCP servers\n9. Hooks 2026: PermissionRequest, async, agent-based, prompt-based\n10. LangGraph: Production leader with PG/Redis checkpointing\n\nIntegration Roadmap:\n- Phase 1 (V64-V65): Agent Booster + Batch API + Caching = 60% cost reduction, 2-3 iterations\n- Phase 2 (V66-V68): ReasoningBank + Extended Thinking = 30% quality gain, 4-6 iterations\n- Phase 3 (V69+): SONA + RuVector + CrewAI = long-term optimization, 10-15 iterations\n\nImmediate Actions (V64):\n1. Implement Agent Booster (tier-0 routing)\n2. Add Batch API wrapper (resilient_sdk.py)\n3. Add prompt caching to top 5 adapters\n4. Test 100-request batch\n\nSources: 40+ official (GitHub repos, Anthropic docs, MCP specs, research papers)\n",
