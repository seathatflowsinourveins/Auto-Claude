  "content": "Completed comprehensive research on Claude Flow V3, Anthropic SDK v0.77.1, MCP protocol v1.26, Letta sleeptime compute, RAPTOR/CRAG RAG techniques, Jina Reranker v3, Voyage-3-large embeddings, and Mem0 graph memory for 2026 integration. Key findings: (1) Letta sleeptime offers 91% latency reduction and 90% token savings - HIGH PRIORITY for Ralph Loop. (2) Anthropic SDK v0.77.1 has BREAKING change output_format\u2192output_config but we don't use it (0 instances found). (3) Jina Reranker v3 achieves 61.94 nDCG@10 with 15x faster inference, 33-47% accuracy boost expected. (4) Claude Flow V3 provides 352x WASM speedup and HNSW 150-12,500x faster search but 171 MCP tools may cause context overhead (we use 11 optimized). (5) RAPTOR tree-organized retrieval shows +5.3% F-1 improvement. (6) MCP protocol SSE deprecated\u2192Streamable HTTP (our stdio transport unaffected). Implementation roadmap: V66 priorities include Letta sleeptime integration, Jina Reranker v3, late chunking, and Message Batches API adoption. V67 priorities include RAPTOR, CRAG, and Mem0 graph memory enhancement. Research stored at docs/RESEARCH_SUMMARY_2026.md with 15+ sources consulted across 51,000+ tokens analyzed.",
